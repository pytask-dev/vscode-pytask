# Pytask Extension

This Extension integrates Pytask into the VS Code Test Explorer. It collects all tasks in the currently opened folder and gives the user the ability to run them with the simple click of a button.

## Installation

1. Search for Pytask in the Extension View of VSCode and install the extension. <img src="doc/icon_ext.png" alt="Extensions Icon" width="16" height="16">

## Passing Command Line Arguments to Pytask

There are two ways to input command line arguments for your pytask run. Open the VSCode Settings and scroll down to the Pytask Extension Settings and select your preferred mode.

- `text` : you will be prompted for a string containing your arguments, like in the terminal
- `list` : you will be presented with a list of all possible arguments
  You will now be asked to input command line arguments each time you run pytask.

> \[!Warning\]
> Currently only arguments that need no further interaction with pytask are supported. For example `--pdb` or `--trace` don't work.

## Troubleshooting

Here you can find Tips for the most commonly occuring problems.

### What to do if my task are not showing up in the Test Explorer?

1. Check if you opened the right folder. If you work from a repository this should usually be the root folder of the project.
1. Check if you selected the right interpreter. You can click on the search bar at the top and then search for the command `Python: Select Interpreter` to change it.
1. Go to the Output Tab and select the Pytask Output Channel. If the collection of the tasks failed, you should see that in the collection report.
1. Check if Port 6000 is blocked by your firewall, the extension needs this port to communicate with pytask.

### What to do if my run never stops or gives a cryptic error message?

1. You can stop the run by clicking on the stop button next to where you started the run.
1. Go to the Output Tab and select the Pytask Output Channel. Sometimes information about the run can be found there.
1. Delete the `.pytask.sqlite3` file in your project directory.
